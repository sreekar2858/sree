          Masters - Mini-Thesis - 
          It is not practicable to analyse numerous support structure patterns, so a computational investigation using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver must be employed to study the thermal and flow characteristics. It is also vital to balance the simulation runtime and accuracy. The workflow for this project uses a feedback loop....
