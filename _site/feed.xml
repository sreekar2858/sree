        <title>DNN &amp; RNN to Predict Impact Location on Aircraft Nose</title>
        <description>
          Masters course project - 
          Abstract: Localization of an impact on an aircraft nosecone is vital to assess the risk of damage. Collecting sensor data from the impact zone and passing it through an Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a better chance of predicting the impact location. This study trains various AI models on computer simulation...
