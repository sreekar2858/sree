<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:30px">Hey There!</p>

<div style="padding: 0px 0px 0px -50px"> My name is <b>Sajjala, Sreekar Reddy</b> <i>(sreekar)</i>. I am currently pursuing Master's degree in Computer-Aided Mechanical Engineering <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/dfvw" target="_blank" title="CAME Website">CAME</a> at RWTH Aachen University, specialization in Conception of Machines. I finished my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at BML Munjal University.</div>

<p> Ever since I started pursing my interest in Mechanical Engineering (ME) I was piqued by the ability to study physical phenomena using mathematical equations. Bachelor's degree in ME helped me build my foundations strong at Machine Design, Automotives, Robotics, Fluid/Thermo-dynamics and Conventional/ Additive Manufacturing. I was intrigued by Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD | CAE). I have solid theoretical and practical experience at using CAD software. I am a certified <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhHpP0kOXLC9mXPEobZGrETynG6MXUZu/view" target="_blank" title="Certificate link">Siemens NX</a> user and proficient in Pro-E, PTC Creo, SolidWorks, Salome and Auto CAD for CAD. Finite Element Methods (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) motivated me to learn more about the structural and fluid characteristics using numerical simulations; I try to employ simulation studies in most of my experimental projects. My courseware and research helped me augment my knowledge beyond ME and introduced me to Artificial Intelligence (AI); I worked on a couple of projects related to ML and ANNs using python, TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, and Scikit-learn. Currently, I am working on my Mini-Thesis: <a href="/2020-02-26-master-minithesis/" title="Topic Page">"Development of an intelligent simulation-based model for design evaluation of cooling channels for L-PBF"</a> to integrate CFD and AI to improve heat transfer in AM application.</p>

<p> I like to work with open-source software such as Deal.ii, Calculix, and OpenFOAM to better understand the implementation of mathematical equations in efficient way to run FEM and FVM simulations. I am proficient at programming using python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB, and VBA. I was tasked to work with wide range of commercial FEM/FVM software during my education and workplace; please refer to my skills on CV page.</p>

<p>
During my free time I like to draw on paper. I was once extremely into Computer Generated Imaging (CGI) and Visual Fx (VFx), I invested huge amount of time learning Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Substance Painter/ Designer, Octane and Redshot renderer and also worked on several projects in simulation R&D using Houdini. I still do 3d-modeling and rendering in free time. I am also a huge fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) for graphics and 2D animation.<br>
Every once in a while, I like to play video games on my PC with my friends. I am a huge fan of FPS and racing games.<br>
I like to play raquet games, I used to play tennis professionally; played table-tennis for university competitions and frequently play badminton with my friends.<br>
