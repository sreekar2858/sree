<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>
Localization of an impact on an aircraft nosecone is vital to assess the risk of damage. Collecting sensor data from the impact zone and passing it through an Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a better chance of predicting the impact location. This study trains various AI models on computer simulation data to predict experimental data. Various AI models were implemented out of which modified Alex Net (mAlexNet) architecture showed relatively better predictions. This report summarises the extension of project B; aiming to improve the impact location prediction, utilising post-processing, and investigating different Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. With the help of post-processing, the prediction from the mAlexNet is narrowed down to the exact impact location. Two new architectures have been adapted to better fit the dataset: Residual Network (ResNet) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG).<br>
