<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Unlike one-step simulation, in which only the final part shape is solved, incremental forming simulation allows the accurate modeling of sheet forming processes. In incremental simulations, the forming process is divided into steps or increments, and the problem is solved incrementally through time. Within each step or increment, the positions, velocities, accelerations, and forces are calculated at the nodal points in the blank. Within each blank element, stresses and strains can be evaluated from nodal displacements. As a more rigorous modeling approach, the incremental analysis allows designers to detect the stage at which process defects occur in the blank during the forming operation.
