<h3>Introduction: </h3>
<p> Metallic implants are commonly used in the orthopedic field. Despite the large number of metallic medical devices in use today, they are predominantly make up of only a few metals. Metallic alloys such as titanium continue to be one of the most important components used in orthopaedic implant devices due to favorable properties of high strength, rigidity, fracture toughness and their reliable mechanical performance as replacement for hard tissues. Orthopaedic implants are medical devices used for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and may consist of a single type of biomaterial or comprise a number of different biomaterials working together in modular parts. Prime examples of titanium implants used in orthopaedics would include prosthetic hip and knee replacements for various types of arthritis affecting these joints, spinal fusion instruments for stabilizing degenerate and unstable vertebral segments, and fracture fixation devices of various types such as plates, screws and intramedullary rods. Although titanium based implants are typically expected to last ten years or more. <br>
<br>
However longevity is not assured and the lack of integration into the bone for long-term survival often occurs and leads to implant failure. Revision surgery to address such failure involves increased risk, complications and costs. The main reason for the failure of these implants is aseptic loosening which accounts for 60 to 70% of the cases for revision surgery. The success of implants is dependent on firm bonding or fixation of implant biomaterial to bone, for optimal function and lastingness. Therefore one of the key challenges in bone healing and regeneration is the engineering of an implant that incorporates Osseo integration with enhanced bioactivity and improved implant-host interactions so as to reduce biological related implant failure.<br>
Metallic biomaterials can be conveniently grouped in the following categories:<br>
• Stainless steel<br>
• Cobalt base alloys<br>
• Titanium base alloys<br>
• Specialty metallic alloys<br>
<br>
The first metal alloy developed specifically for human use was the “vanadium steel” but it was no longer used in implants because its corrosion resistance is inadequate in vivo. Later in the 1950s, 18-8sMo with very low carbon content (known as 316L) stainless steel was introduced and is actually widely used for implant fabrication. This alloy has a very good resistance to chloride solutions and poor sensitization. The castable CoCrMo alloy has been used for many decades in dentistry and, relatively recently, in making artificial joints. The wrought CoNiCrMo alloy is relatively new, now used for making the stems of prostheses for heavily loaded joints such as the knee and hip. Both alloys have excellent corrosion resistance.<br>
Attempts to use titanium for implant fabrication dates to the late 1930s. It was found that titanium was tolerated as was stainless steels and cobalt alloys. Titanium’s lightness and good mechano-chemical properties are salient features for implant application. Also, there were even assumptions on a possible bioactive behaviour (Li et al., 1994) due to the slow growth of hydrated titanium oxide on the surface of the titanium implant that leads the incorporation of calcium and phosphorous.
