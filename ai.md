Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. An AI system combines and utilises mainly machine learning and other types of data analytics methods to achieve artificial intelligence capabilities. AI is ubiquitous today, used to recommend what you should buy next online, to understand what you say to virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, to recognise who and what is in a photo, spot spam, or spot spam detect credit card fraud.<br>

At a very high level, artificial intelligence can be split into two broad types:<br>
1. Narrow AI <br>
2. General AI<br>
