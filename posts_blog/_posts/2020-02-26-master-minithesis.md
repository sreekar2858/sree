<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>
This research presents an approach in developing a simulation-based artificial neural network (NN) model for the design evaluation of cooling channel structures in additively manufactured (AM) components. The popularity of AM, specifically Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), has been growing due to its ability to produce complex and efficient components with little to no waste and environmental impact. In AM, support columns can be manufactured and used as internal cooling channels to transfer heat efficiently. However, conducting numerous numerical experiments to study the structural, thermal, and fluid characteristics is not feasible. To address this challenge, a simulation based NN model is proposed, trained on a dataset generated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, to predict fluid flow and temperature in cooling channels. The NN model is validated using unseen geometry and inlet velocity and has the potential to reduce time and effort in the development cycle of cooling channels by eliminating the need for tedious case setups and long simulation run times. This NN model has applications in industries where heat is taken out through conduction and convection and can be refined-and-improved in the future.<br>

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>
It is not practicable to analyze a combination of support column patterns analytically or experimentally, so a numerical investigation using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver must be employed to study the thermal and flow characteristics. It is also vital to balance the simulation runtime and accuracy. This thesis aims to present a validated and optimized solver and case-setup to run CHT simulations for internal cooling channels in an open-source application.<br>
Simulation-based neural network (NN) model is a potential alternative to CFD simulation for studying thermal and flow profile in cooling channel structures. The NN model trained on a dataset generated by CHT simulations will be able to make predictions about the temperature and fluid flow in a cooling channel based on input parameters. This approach is intended to be a significantly faster and possibly an accurate alternative to traditional design evaluation methods such as CFD simulations. The NN model will be trained on a large and diverse dataset to explore its performance.<br>
Validation accuracy and loss are used to evaluate if the NN model is over or under-fitting the dataset. This thesisâ€™s scope is to successfully implement a NN model with the least loss into the development cycle, and time spent on researching novel geometry can be significantly reduced with similar results as numerical simulation.
This way the tedious case setups and simulation run times can be eliminated in the development cycle of cooling channels.<br>

<h4>Methodology:</h4>
This thesis presents a comprehensive study of the heat transfer in a cooling channel and proposes the use of GNN to predict temperature and flow characteristics. The study begins with the creation of parametric geometry that includes four cross-sections each with three density ratios as mentioned in Figure 4-1. A validation study is performed against experimental results to configure the OpenFOAM case setup using chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam solver. CHT simulations were performed on all the geometric configurations at several Reynolds Numbers in the turbulent flow regime.<br>
Results from the CHT simulations were used to create a simulation dataset. A GNN model is created using the PyTorch library and is trained on the dataset after preprocessing it. Finally, a validation study is conducted on unseen input parameters and novel geometry.<br>
