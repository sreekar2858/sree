Gas and liquid flow behavior is quantified by partial differential equations representing conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to solve fluid flows situations. Numerical simulations are performed to study the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. <br>

CFD is based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Arising from applying Newtonâ€™s second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term and a pressure term, these equations describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid are correlated.<br>

Here, I present some of the projects I worked on the past and some current projects I am working on. I also provide some useful links to learn CFD.<br>
