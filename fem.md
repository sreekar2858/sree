I believe everything in nature, be biological, mechanical, or geological with the aid of the laws of physics can be expressed in mathematical notations. Determining mechanical behavior of a system is a complex task. Defining such system in partial differential equations (PDEs) which are subsequently solved for a result is extremely difficult and tidious.  Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical method to solve PDEs by discretizing the domain into finite number of elements and solving the equations at each element. The solution at each element is then combined to obtain the solution at the entire domain. FEM is a powerful tool to solve complex problems in engineering and science. It is used in almost every engineering field such as structural, fluid, thermal, and electromagnetic analysis. FEM is also used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to solve fluid flow problems.<br>

Here, I brief on some of the projects I worked on the past and some current projects I am working on. I also provide some useful links to learn FEM.<br>
