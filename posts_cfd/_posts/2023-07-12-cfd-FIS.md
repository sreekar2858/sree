<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on implementation of two iterative solvers, Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), for solving sparse linear systems. The implementation explores the impact of preconditioning on the convergence behavior and computational efficiency of the GMRES method, considering different restart parameters (m = 30, 50, 100). The sparse linear systems are represented using the Modified Sparse Row (MSR) format for efficient storage and manipulation. Conjugate Gradient method, designed for symmetric positive definite systems, is implemented. Several evaluations are conducted to analyze convergence rate, Krylov vectors, and execution time. The results highlight the effectiveness of GMRES with preconditioning in achieving faster convergence. CG with relative residual and absolute error is compared.<br>
